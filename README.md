# Redux YouOwn

Redux YouOwn was made by me, as a video platform.Inspired by video platforms such as youtube,dailymotion etc.I made a video platform that would show you videos based on popular genres for example : 

1)horror
2)action and entertainment
3)Kids
4)inspirational
5)DIY's

The categories (can be selected one or more than one) would help the user to get content of his/her choice.Moreover, the user also has 
personal dashboard where all his record his kept safe,such as:

1)Likes made and on which video.
2)Comments made on videos.
3)Videos saved (a feature to save video).
4)The categories the user has visited.

This dashboard would help user to see his/her personal record.
